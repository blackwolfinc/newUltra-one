        interacting with us. Depending upon your level of interaction, we will

        through your use of our SITE. The type of information collected is as
        follows:
        <br />
        <br />
        &bull; Members - Members are those users who subscribe to our services

        to post information in our public forums. We collect your email address
        and the password you create for your account when you register, and we

        entered voluntarily by the Poster on one of our forums should be
        considered public information or information that is publicly available.
        If you do not wish for information to be made public, you should not
        enter it into your user profile when registering as a Poster.
        <br />
        <br />
        &bull; All SITE users and visitors - We automatically collect the
        following information from all users and visitors to our SITE through
        cookies, web beacons, and other technologies: your domain name; your
        br/owser type and operating system; web pages you view; links you click;
        your IP address; the length of time you visit or use our SITE; and the
        referring URL, or the webpage that led you to our SITE. We may combine
        this information with other information that we have collected about
        you, including, where applicable, your username, name, and other
        personal information. Please see the section &ldquo;Cookies and Other
        Tracking Mechanisms&rdquo; below for more information.
        <br />
        <br />
        <h3>IV. Our Use of Cookies and Other Tracking Mechanisms</h3>
        <br />
        We and our third-party service providers use cookies and other tracking
        mechanisms, including those designed for mobile applications, to track
        information about your use of our SITE. We may combine this information
        with other personal information we collect from you (and our third-party
        service providers may do so on our behalf).
        <br />
        <br />
        &bull; Cookies. Cookies are alphanumeric identifiers that we transfer to
        your device&rsquo;s hard drive through your web br/owser for
        record-keeping purposes. Some cookies allow us to make it easier for you
        to navigate our SITE, while others are used to enable a faster log-in
        process or to allow us to track your activities at our SITE and service,
        including for online advertising purposes.
        <br />
        <br />
        &bull; Disabling Cookies. Most web br/owsers automatically accept
        cookies, but if you prefer, you can edit your br/owser options to block
        them in the future. The Help portion of the toolbar on most br/owsers
        will tell you how to prevent your computer from accepting new cookies,
        how to have the br/owser notify you when you receive a new cookie, or
        how to disable cookies altogether. Visitors to our SITE who disable
        cookies will be able to br/owse certain areas of the SITE, but some
        features may not function.
        <br />
        <br />
        &bull; Clear GIFs, pixel tags and other technologies. Clear GIFs are
        tiny graphics with a unique identifier, similar in function to cookies.
        In contrast to cookies stored on your device&rsquo;s hard drive, clear
        GIFs are embedded invisibly on web pages. We may use clear GIFs (a.k.a.
        web beacons, web bugs, or pixel tags) in connection with our site to,
        among other things, track the activities of SITE visitors and users,
        help us manage content, and compile statistics about Site usage. We and
        our third-party service providers also use clear GIFs in HTML emails to
        our customers to help us track email response rates, identify when our
        emails are viewed, and track whether our emails are forwarded.
        <br />
        <br />
        &bull; Third-Party Analytics. We use automated devices and applications,
        such as Google Analytics, to evaluate usage of our SITE. We also may use
        other analytic means to evaluate our SITE. We use these tools to help us
        improve our services, performance, and user experiences. These entities
        may use cookies and other tracking technologies to perform their
        services. To learn more about Google&rsquo;s privacy practices, please
        review the Google Policy at <br />
        Privacy Policy &ndash; Privacy &amp; Terms &ndash; Google. You can also
        download the Google Analytics Opt-out br/owser Add-on to prevent their
        data from being used by Google Analytics at
        https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout.
        <br />
        <br />
        &bull; Do-Not-Track. Currently, our systems do not recognize br/owser
        &ldquo;do-not-track&rdquo; requests. You may, however, disable certain
        tracking as discussed in this section (e.g., by disabling cookies); you
        also may opt-out of targeted advertising by following the instructions
        in the Third-Party Ad Network section.
        <br />
        <br />
        &bull; Third-Party Ad Networks. We use third parties such as network
        advertisers to serve advertisements on third-party websites or other
        media (e.g., social networking platforms). This enables us and these
        third parties to target advertisements to you for products and services
        in which you might be interested. Third-party ad network providers,
        advertisers, sponsors and/or traffic measurement services may use
        cookies, JavaScript, web beacons (including clear GIFs), Flash LSOs, and
        other tracking technologies to measure the effectiveness of their ads
        and to personalize advertising content to you. These third-party cookies
        and other technologies are governed by each third party&rsquo;s specific
        privacy policy, not this one. We may provide these third-party
        advertisers with information, including personal information, about you.
        <br />
        <br />
        Users in the United States may opt-out of many third-party ad networks.
        For example, you may go to the Digital Advertising Alliance
        (&ldquo;DAA&rdquo;) Consumer Choice Page for information about opting
        out of interest-based advertising and their choices regarding having
        information used by DAA companies. You may also go to the Network
        Advertising Initiative (&ldquo;NAI&rdquo;) Consumer Opt-Out Page for
        information about opting out of interest-based advertising and their
        choices regarding having information used by NAI members.
        <br />
        <br />
        Opting out from one or more companies listed on the DAA Consumer Choice
        Page or the NAI Consumer Opt-Out Page will opt you out from those
        companies&rsquo; delivery of interest-based content or ads to you, but
        it does not mean you will no longer receive any advertising through our
        SITE or on other websites. You may continue to receive advertisements,
        for example, based on the website that you are viewing (i.e.,
        contextually based ads). Also, if your br/owsers are configured to
        reject cookies when you opt-out on the DAA or NAI websites, your opt out
        may not be effective. Additional information is available on the
        DAA&rsquo;s website at www.aboutads.info or the NAI&rsquo;s website at
        www.networkadvertising.org.

        immediately be considered to be public information.
        <br />
        <br />
        &bull; Member Directories - Any information provided in a user profile,

        We have implemented reasonable precautions to protect the information we

        data encryption, to protect the transmission of sensitive end-user

        measures will prevent third-party &ldquo;hackers&rdquo; from illegally
        obtaining this information. We take reasonable measures to prevent such
        br/eaches of security, but given the resourcefulness of cyber-criminals,
        we are unable to guarantee that our security is 100% br/each-proof. You
        assume the risk of such br/eaches to the extent that they occur despite
        our reasonable security measures.
